    "fear" : Presentation(
        id: 8,
        speaker: tko2019Speakers["ash"],
        title: "Circumventing Fear of the Unknown",
        summary: "Have you ever seen Batman Begins? There's this great line where a bad guy says 'you always fear what you don't understand', and while I think there may be some truth to that, humans are pretty smart and I think we can probably figure out how to overcome our fears. When building software, we come across things we don't understand all the time. Overcoming our fear of what's beyond our understanding is incredibly useful to be happy and productive programmers. In this talk, Ash Furrow will go over some examples of things that scared him, and some of the techniques he uses to overcome that fear."

    "server" : Presentation(
        id: 13,
        speaker: tko2019Speakers["gopal"],
        title: "Swift on Server: Are We There Yet?",
        summary: "Swift on the server has been talked about since Swift was open sourced. There have been a lot of efforts to make Swift on the server viable. However, when building a product, you should be focused on your product, not on the tools and frameworks backing it. This talk evaluates the holistic experience of building a small (but real) backend in Swift, versus a few well known frameworks in other languages, and tries to answer the age old question: Are we there yet?"
    ),
    
    "swiftnioNetwork" : Presentation(
        id: 14,
        speaker: tko2019Speakers["jw"],
        title: "SwiftNIO and Network.framework",
        summary: "SwiftNIO was developed with a focus on providing useful, high-performance tools for building event-driven networking applications on the server side. It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple's client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It'll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time."

    "generic" : Presentation(
        id: 15,
        speaker: tko2019Speakers["jt"],
        title: "Making it Generic",
        summary: "Generic programming is a powerful paradigm that improves productivity and safety by allowing components to be reused without modification. In this talk, you will learn to make generic programs by identifying common requirements in a collection of similar concrete types."

    "siri" : Presentation(
        id: 17,
        speaker: tko2019Speakers["christina"],
        title: "Let Them Say What They Want: Adding Siri Shortcuts",
        summary: "Siri Shortcuts help to improve your user experience by making actions available with Siri in iOS, watchOS, CarPlay and HomePod. We can set up our apps to give easy access to frequent actions without needing to open the app. Even better, iOS can suggest frequently used actions pro-actively using notifications or the lock screen.</p><p>We’ll see how to add custom Siri Shortcuts to our apps, how to  expose them so that Siri can recommend them, and how to let users set up their own voice commands to access their favourite Shortcuts."

    "mlstart" : Presentation(
        id: 18,
        speaker: tko2019Speakers["audrey"],
        title: "Getting Started with Apple ML",
        summary: "You want to add ML to your apps but you think you need to study a lot of math and write Python and you can’t find the time? Think again: Apple’s Create ML gets you started in the comfort of Xcode and Swift! No math needed :]. Create ML is brilliant for getting you started with ML. It makes it easy to try different datasets — getting your data right is actually the hardest and most time consuming part of ML. Once you get started with ML, you won’t want to wait / hope for Apple to add more models to Create ML. To help you explore the ML universe that’s written in Python, I’ll reduce the fright factor by comparing Create ML Swift with Turi Create Python, and showing you how to quick-start your exploration of Turi Create. And I’ll point you to Keras and scikit-learn, in case you want to roll your own models."

        title: "Effective Core Data with Swift",
        summary: "Core Data brings a lot of power to an app and continues to evolve, but it can have rough spots when you're working in Swift. What if you want to save an enum pr a struct? Does it help if your data is Codable? What's the best way to create Swift-friendly model classes? This session will cover techniques and gotchas for integrating Core Data with your Swift code."

        title: "Compassionate—Yet Candid—Code Reviews",
        summary: "Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and helping developers sharpen their coding skills. However, code reviews are also difficult to get right. Many code review comments end up being unclear, trivial, or condescending.</p><p>With compassion as a guideline, though, we can work to establish code review practices that minimize suffering for everyone involved—the code authors, the code reviewers, the code maintainers, and even the end users.</p><p>In this talk, you’ll learn that Compassionate Code Reviews are not about “sugarcoating” feedback and actually demand a considerable degree of candor. Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you’ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders."
